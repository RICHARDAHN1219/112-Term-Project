For now, let's design a 2v2 game for the Ai design to be better. Let's have it so there are the moves set
Have 3 touches in general, and for the 3 touches, let it be bump, set, spike moveset every time.

BUMP:
- Upper hand
- Lower hand
- Direction will go automatically the same trajectory it came from, but it can switch if another directional key is pressed

SET
- mid air
- minus tempo: 0
- 1st tempo: 1
- 2nd temp: 2
- 3rd temp: 3
GAGE: Increases time it stays in air until spike gage shows up

SPIKE
- Dink
- Cross
- Straight (automatic)
- Set a gage
